# K-means clustering techniques using PCA
we will use K-means clustering techniques to explore Fashion MNIST dataset.   The idea is to consider the Fashion MNIST dataset and to classify its content in an unsupervised manner. The resulting clusters are then compared to the 10 known classes of datatset. 

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) stands as a widely used unsupervised learning method aimed at diminishing the dimensions of data. This approach enhances comprehensibility, all the while minimizing the loss of information. By identifying the most crucial attributes within a dataset, it facilitates straightforward visualization in both two and three dimensions. Furthermore, PCA aids in the identification of a series of linear variable combinations.
